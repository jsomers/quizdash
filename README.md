- quiz and question model validations and form errors
- ENTER key behavior in text boxes (catch key event and do a focus or something (maybe nothing) if not last input)

- refactor, prune, and clean

- hook up juggernaut
- play with data shifting around
- get individual game working independently of game room

- automatically generating quizzes from a subset of the questions tied to that quiz. randomly select them or choose cleverly.
- matchmaking options? discuss with freedman and silber.
- sessions -> migrate to accounts (pre-populate signup with chosen handle and save the session stats)

- get a version that works up and hosted quickly
- use juggernaut
- each game is a channel
- discover channels by browsing
- abstract away from quiz content
- the "quizdash" is the dashboard of _your_ quiz performance
- extra points for guessing something that no one else has guessed
- admin interface for easily adding new quizzes
- every quiz is a json object:
 	- a set of blanks to be filled in
	- permissible answers for each blank (must these be specified manually?)
	- label
	- description
	- time limit
- channels are independent of games/quizzes
- min of two players before a channel's status can be okayed to go, then there's a countdown, a period during which other people can join that game, and games with more players (up to a max) are sorted st they have higher priority (but not a total lock, some randomness involved)
- memcached for channel status and ids and such?
- players have a handle and also a short message / quote
- how to avoid keeping people waiting in a waiting area for too long, but not give away the content of the upcoming game? Also want to give people a chance to read the instructions.
- sessions and player disconnects?
- submitting an answer sends a message which on_success validates back to user and to everyone else and on_fail does nothing
- syncing games and managing timers
- histogram with everyone's progress. or, they could show activity on the site more generally!
- your position out of n players
- flash colors in the spots when other players get there (how to represent this?)
	- one idea is a bunch of small multiples, each of which looks like a minified version of the whole board, each tied to a person's name then the slots there would be filled in and the mini-boxes as a whole would be sorted according to who was doing what.
	- perhaps cleaner would be something like github's little commit dots, one for each slot and a set for each player, that are gradually filled in as players answer questions.
- login for users, stats, etc.
- can RAILS handle all these concurrent connections? How to scale?
- first blood (fps game mechanics) / badges for end of match / flawless victory! (first to answer every question)
- calling out a tough question (~wager)
- blanking out other people's questions / fuck with their typing
- daily doubles
- party mode / matchmaking
