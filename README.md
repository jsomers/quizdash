- get a version that works up and hosted quickly
- use juggernaut
- each game is a channel
- discover channels by browsing
- abstract away from quiz content
- the "quizdash" is the dashboard of _your_ quiz performance
- extra points for guessing something that no one else has guessed
- admin interface for easily adding new quizzes
- every quiz is a json object:
 	- a set of blanks to be filled in
	- permissible answers for each blank (must these be specified manually?)
	- label
	- description
	- time limit
- channels are independent of games/quizzes
- min of two players before a channel's status can be okayed to go, then there's a countdown, a period during which other people can join that game, and games with more players (up to a max) are sorted st they have higher priority (but not a total lock, some randomness involved)
- memcached for channel status and ids and such?
- players have a handle and also a short message / quote
- how to avoid keeping people waiting in a waiting area for too long, but not give away the content of the upcoming game? Also want to give people a chance to read the instructions.
- sessions and player disconnects?
- submitting an answer sends a message which on_success validates back to user and to everyone else and on_fail does nothing
- syncing games and managing timers
- histogram with everyone's progress
- your position out of n players
- flash colors in the spots when other players get there (how to represent this?)
	- one idea is a bunch of small multiples, each of which looks like a minified version of the whole board, each tied to a person's name then the slots there would be filled in and the mini-boxes as a whole would be sorted according to who was doing what.
	- perhaps cleaner would be something like github's little commit dots, one for each slot and a set for each player, that are gradually filled in as players answer questions.
